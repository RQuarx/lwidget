**lwidget** is a lightweight UI toolkit that combines a **C backend** with a **Lua frontend**. You write your interface in Lua, and lwidget builds it using GTK behind the scenes.

The name comes from **Lua + widget**, and also nods to **lvalues** in C++, where things are named and assignable. In lwidget, your widgets are structured, named, and easy to manipulate.
